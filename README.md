## Swift.plist

This is a [Codeless Language Module](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) for [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). It allows TextWrangler (and theoretically even BBEdit) to support (very) basic Swift syntax. The basic outline is taken from the [Examples](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html#Examples) section. The module could do with support for advanced features such as functions.

#### How to use:
Place the file in your `~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/` directory and restart TextWrangler. The program should now automatically register `.swift` files for syntax highlighting.
